**My personal english coach**
=============================

A fully self-hosted conversational chatbot built on a customized LLama 3.2 LLM and wrapped with OpenAI Whisper and Coqui-TTS for real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversions.

**Overview**
------------

Enjoy instant, unlimited chat with a personalized conversational agent to help you develop your spoken English. It gives you personalized advice to help you improve your conversational skills. This chatbot is always available and powered for discussions in English, while benefiting from the general culture of an LLM. What's more, it's completely free and keeps no conversation history. 
This self-hosted chatbot integrates OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition and coqui-TTS for text-to-speech, providing excellent performance/resource ratios. Speech-to-text (STT) transcribes the user's speech into text. The transcribed text is analyzed by the customized LLM: it takes into account the speech-to-text limitations, suggests linguistic corrections and feeds the conversation. Chatbot responses are generated in real time using an asynchronous background process that parallelizes the generation of text and audio files.
The application features a local client in console mode, as well as a web client/server solution containing a lightweight chat room website.


**Features**
------------

* Conversational AI chatbot
* Speech-to-text technology using OpenAI Whisper
* Response generation using Coqui-TTS and a Large Language Model (LLM)
* Real-time response generation using an async background process
* Integration with FastAPI framework for efficient and scalable development
